      <h2>Graphic Photography</h2>
      <p>Michael Nguyen is an artist, not a photographer but more a photographic poet or something he himself could not define. He moves away from the mainstream, at the same time blurs genres. Most of the time, he focuses on small, ordinary things
        but
        through the subjective lens, give them new perspectives, a new soul. „Michael Nguyen’s photography is the art of showing more than you can see. Making visible – worshipping the invisible, he walks with the third eye of a wanderer through the
        visual adventure of life.</p>
